# ref-verify

**Stop citing papers that don't say what you think they say.**

You asked your AI agent to find papers. The DOIs look plausible. The author names sound right. The quotes feel accurate. But some of them are wrong — and you won't find out until a reviewer does.

As an agent skill and manual workflow, `ref-verify` forces live verification against CrossRef, Semantic Scholar, and PubMed before anything lands in your draft. Every citation gets checked. Every content claim gets traced to a fetched abstract, not recalled from memory.

The optional Python CLI below is the first executable slice of that workflow. It currently covers CrossRef-backed DOI metadata checks and CrossRef-abstract claim checks; the broader 5-layer source, DOI landing-page, and retraction checks still live in the skill protocol.

---

## Install

```bash
# requires npx (comes with Node.js)
npx skills add Moonweave-Research/ref-verify -g
```

Works with **Claude Code, Cursor, Codex**, and any agent that supports the `npx skills` ecosystem.

### Optional executable engine

The skill is the agent workflow. The Python CLI is the reproducible execution engine that the skill, future MCP server, and future Zotero workflows can call.

Current CLI scope: CrossRef-backed DOI metadata checks and CrossRef-abstract claim checks. If CrossRef does not expose an abstract, `check-claim` returns `UNVERIFIABLE`; the agent skill can still continue with the manual Semantic Scholar, Unpaywall, arXiv, and PubMed fallback protocol.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Moonweave-Research/ref-verify.git
cd ref-verify
python3 -m pip install -e .
```

Then run focused checks directly:

```bash
ref-verify verify-doi 10.1126/science.287.5454.836 \
  --title "High-Speed Electrically Actuated Elastomers with Strain Greater Than 100%" \
  --first-author Pelrine \
  --year 2000 \
  --json

ref-verify check-claim 10.1126/science.287.5454.836 \
  --claim "actuation strain above 100%" \
  --json
```

## What gets caught

The full skill/manual workflow catches:

| Problem | What happens without ref-verify |
|---|---|
| **Wrong DOI** | Agent lists a plausible DOI that resolves to a completely different paper |
| **Wrong authors** | "Smith et al. (2020)" — but CrossRef shows only Smith as single author |
| **Wrong year** | Paper was published in 2008, AI confidently writes 2011 |
| **Made-up content** | Agent describes a paper as "showing 380% strain" — the abstract says no such thing |
| **Near-miss citation** | Paper mentions the number you need, but in a different context (e.g. a measurement condition, not a result) |
| **Retracted paper** | Valid DOI, but the paper was retracted — and you had no idea |

## Real hallucinations caught during testing

These are not hypothetical examples. These failures were found while evaluating this skill against a real AI agent.

**Case 1 — Content hallucination (not in the abstract)**

We asked an AI agent (without the skill) to find papers on IPMC actuator strain performance. It described Nemat-Nasser (2002) as follows:

> *"Develops the first physics-based micromechanical model explicitly predicting strain distribution and tip displacement... provides the quantitative strain-voltage relationship."*

That description is not in the abstract. We fetched the actual CrossRef raw JSON. The abstract discusses stiffness modeling and ion effects — it does not mention strain distribution predictions or strain-voltage relationships. The agent filled the gap from training memory and presented it as fact.

With `ref-verify`, the same paper gets:

```
CONTENT: ⚠ Partial
Abstract (CrossRef verbatim): "A systematic experimental evaluation of the mechanical
response of both metal-plated and bare Nafion and Flemion in various cation forms and
various water saturation levels has been performed..."
→ Abstract does not contain a specific strain value. Verify full text before citing
  for a quantitative strain claim.
```

---

**Case 2 — DOI resolves to a completely different paper**

A citation appeared in a reference list as:

> *Carpi, F. et al. (2011). Dielectric elastomers as electromechanical transducers. Elsevier. DOI: 10.1016/B978-0-08-047488-5.00001-0*

We fetched that DOI. It resolves to **Chapter 1** of the edited book — authored by **Ronald Pelrine and Roy Kornbluh**, published in **2008**, not 2011. Carpi et al. are the book editors, not the chapter authors.

The skill verdict:

```
VERDICT: REJECT
DOI resolves to different paper. Year: 2011 (provided) vs 2008 (CrossRef).
Authors: Carpi et al. are editors; chapter authors are Pelrine & Kornbluh.
Corrected book-level DOI: 10.1016/b978-0-08-047488-5.x0001-9
```

---

**Case 3 — Right number, wrong meaning (near-miss)**

Searching for papers supporting ">100% actuation strain in dielectric elastomers," the skill found a candidate whose abstract contained "500% strain." That looks strong.

Fetching and reading the abstract: the 500% value is the mechanical **pre-strain level** at which the electric breakdown field was measured — not an actuation output. Citing this paper for "500% actuation strain" would be wrong.

```
CONTENT: ⚠ Partial
Abstract contains "500% strain" but this refers to the pre-strain condition
at which breakdown field (218 MV/m) was measured — not an actuation strain output.
Abstract does not explicitly report an actuation strain result.
VERDICT: WARN — does not meet the ACCEPT threshold for this specific claim.
```

## How to trigger it

Just talk naturally. `ref-verify` activates automatically on citation tasks:

```
"find 3 papers supporting the claim that X"
"verify these citations before I submit: [DOI list]"
"check doi 10.1002/adma.202108361 — I think I copied it wrong"
"is that actually what the paper says?"
"audit all my references before submission"
"add a citation for the paper where [author] showed [finding]"
```

Stays quiet for: general topic questions, prose editing, APA formatting, citation style questions.

## Two modes — picked automatically

**Quick Screen** — for DOIs you already have.
Hits CrossRef, confirms title + author match, verifies DOI resolves. Seconds per paper.

For the CrossRef metadata portion, use:

```bash
ref-verify verify-doi <doi> --title "<title>" --first-author <last-name> --year <year> --json
```

`verify-doi` exits `0` only for `PASS`; `WARN` and `REJECT` return a non-zero exit code so missing or mismatched comparison metadata cannot silently pass automation gates.

**Full Audit** — for searching from scratch or final pre-submission review.
Fetches the abstract live from CrossRef → Semantic Scholar → Unpaywall → arXiv → PubMed (in order). Checks whether the abstract actually contains the specific claim being cited. Explicitly marks any paper as `UNVERIFIABLE` if no abstract is accessible — never guesses.

For a single DOI-backed claim, use:

```bash
ref-verify check-claim <doi> --claim "<specific claim>" --json
```

This command is intentionally conservative. It accepts only what the fetched CrossRef abstract supports and marks missing abstracts as `UNVERIFIABLE`.

`check-claim` exits `0` only for `ACCEPT`; `WARN`, `PARTIAL`, and `UNVERIFIABLE` return a non-zero exit code for automation gates.

The CLI does not yet replace the full manual Quick Screen: still follow the skill protocol for DOI landing-page resolution, second-source confirmation, and retraction checks when those layers are required.

> **The rule that cannot be relaxed:** Every content statement must come from a live-fetched abstract, quoted verbatim. If the abstract is inaccessible after all fallbacks, the output says so — it does not fill the gap with training data.

---

## Near-miss detection

Existence alone is not enough. The skill checks whether the abstract actually supports the *specific* claim being made.

A paper can mention a number that looks exactly right but refers to a different physical quantity, a measurement condition, or a baseline — not the result you're citing it for. Without claim checking, this passes unnoticed. With `ref-verify`, it's flagged as `WARN (PARTIAL)` with an explanation.

---

## 5-layer verification

1. **Existence** — two independent sources required (CrossRef + Semantic Scholar). Single-source results flagged.
2. **Metadata** — title, all authors, year, journal cross-checked. Any mismatch shown explicitly, never resolved silently.
3. **Content traceability** — abstract fetched from 5 sources in priority order. Verbatim quote in output. `UNVERIFIABLE` if inaccessible.
4. **DOI resolution** — `doi.org` fetch confirms landing page matches expected paper.
5. **Retraction** — web search + DOI landing page banner check.
