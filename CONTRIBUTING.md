# Contributing to ref-verify

Thank you for helping improve citation verification. Contributions of all kinds are welcome — new failure modes, broader API coverage, improved trigger descriptions, and additional test cases.

---

## Ways to contribute

### Report a hallucination case

If `ref-verify` missed a real error (false negative) or flagged something incorrectly (false positive), open an issue with:

- The prompt you used
- What the skill returned
- What the correct result should have been
- The DOI or paper title involved

These are the most valuable contributions. Real failure cases are how the skill improves.

### Add a test case

Test cases live in `evals/evals.json`. A good test case:

- Uses a real DOI that can be independently verified
- Tests a specific failure mode (wrong author, hallucinated content, near-miss, retracted paper)
- Has a clear `expected_output` description

See the existing three cases for format reference.

### Run verification locally

Before opening a pull request, run the source tests:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python3 -m py_compile src/ref_verify/*.py tests/*.py scripts/*.py
```

For release or packaging changes, also build and smoke-test the package:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade build twine
python3 -m build --sdist --wheel --outdir dist .
python3 -m twine check dist/*
version="$(python3 -c 'import re; print(re.search(r"^version = \"([^\"]+)\"", open("pyproject.toml", encoding="utf-8").read(), re.M).group(1))')"
python3 scripts/package_smoke.py --wheel dist/ref_verify-*.whl --expected-version "$version"
```

The live API smoke workflow is manual because it calls public academic APIs and
can fail when an upstream service is slow or unavailable.

The PyPI publish workflow uses trusted publishing. Before publishing from a
GitHub Release, configure PyPI Trusted Publisher for this repository and the
GitHub environment named `pypi`; otherwise the release build can pass and the
final publish step will still fail.

### Improve the skill

`SKILL.md` is the skill itself — the instructions the agent follows. Improvements should:

- Solve a documented problem (link to an issue or test case)
- Not add scope beyond citation verification
- Keep the two-mode design intact (Quick Screen and Full Audit)
- Preserve the core rule: every content statement must be verbatim from a fetched abstract

### Extend API coverage

Currently covers: CrossRef, Semantic Scholar, Unpaywall, arXiv, PubMed.

Additions worth considering: Retraction Watch API, DOAJ for open-access status, IEEE Xplore for conference papers, bioRxiv for life-science preprints.

## Submitting changes

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b fix/description-near-miss` or `feat/retraction-watch-api`
3. Make your change
4. Test it: run the skill on the `evals/evals.json` cases and verify outputs look correct
5. Open a pull request — use the template provided

Pull requests that include a new test case or a documented before/after example are much easier to review and merge.

---

## What not to change

- Do not weaken the core rule (verbatim abstract traceability)
- Do not merge Quick Screen and Full Audit into a single mode
- Do not add verification for non-academic sources (web pages, blog posts) — that is a different problem
